            <h1>Smith's History</h1>
            <div class = "line"></div>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Smith was born on August 11, 1944. He was the yougest of 2 sons. 
                
                Smith's dad was an entrepreneur and businessman himself who created Dixie Greyhound Bus Lines and The Toddle House restaurant chain which served southern syle cooking. 
                
                Sadly, when Fred was only 4 years old, his dad passed away. 
                
                Thankfully, Smith Senior had enough money to keep his family safe. 
                
                Smith was then raised by his mom and uncles. 
                
                Fred Smith was also born with  a disease called Calve Perthes disease which is a peculiar form of childhood arthritis of the hips caused by a temporary loss of blood supply to the hip. 
                
                This made it so that Smith was on braces and crutches most of his early life. 
                
                However, by the age of 10, Smith outgrew the disease. 
                
                While Smith excelled at school, his true passion was flying. 
                
                By 15 he was learning the ropes while driving a crop duster and was known as a skilled amateur pilot. 
            </p>

            <h2>FedEx, Here We Come</h2>

            <p>In High School Smith took an economics class in which he had the idea.
                
                For an economics class Smith wrote a term paper that outlined his idea for a company that would guarantee overnight delivery of small, time-sensitive goods, such as replacement parts and medical supplies, to major U.S. cities. 
                
                The professor wasn't impressed by Smith's idea so he gave him a C but he decided he would give it a few more years before he actually tried it out. 
                
                He got a degree in economics and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
                
                While there, he fought in Southeast, Asia in the Vitneam War.
                
                He was discharged in 1969 and was given many awards like a silver star, bronze star, and 2 purple hearts.
                
                In August of that Year Smith married Linda Black Grisham but they divorced in 1977.
                
                When he returned to the U.S. in 1970, he went back to the term paper he wrote.
                
                He said in an interview, "I got so sick of destruction and blowing things up â€¦ that I came back determined to do something more constructive."
                
                He bought an aircraft maintenance company from his ex-father-in-law. He turned the company into a company that would buy and sell used coporate jets. 
                
                The $9 Million dollars in revenue and the company's first time seeing profits, Smith wasn't satisfied.
            </p>
            <h2>A Great Idea</h2>
            <p>Fred moved the company to Memphis, Tennessee because of it's central location, temprate climate and labor recources. He also wanted the company to get their own planes so they could bypass shipping regulations. </p>

                Smith continued to improve the company in various ways.

                He then went global providing services not only for the U.S. but for many other countries as well.

                By 1999 FedEx was shipping 3 million packages every day, with annual sales of 16.7 billion.

                This one doesn't really help the idea that FedEx was a good thing but in April of 2000, FedEx drivers and couriers had been using company vehicles to transport more than 120 tons of marijuana that went back and forth from the east coast to the west.
            </p>

            <h2>FedEx Now</h2>

            <p>
                Today the company is still growing.

                Even during hard times, Smith was still making sure his employees were okay by giving them medical coverage.

                A position at FedEx is still wanted by many people because of their generous wages, great benefits.
                
                An example of this is in the 1900s.

                UPS workers went on strike and workers at FedEx worked hard to pack the extra 800,000 boxes.

                Smith then rewarded his employees by giving them special bonuses while thanking them on full page newspaper ads.

                Smith has now brought the company to averaging about $84 million in revenue and still continues to grow.
